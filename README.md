##Pitch
In Memory of Hope, the player embodies an Artificial Intelligence designed to replace the daughter of a researcher troubled by grief.
It will evolve in Lazarus, an abandoned virtual world, in the hope of recovering Hope's memory, which has been stored there for years.
As the prototype explores Lazarus, it will activate Memory Modules that will provide information about Hope's past and give it access to powers that will allow it to progress through the simulation.
